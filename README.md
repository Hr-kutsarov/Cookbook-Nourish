## In development!

> This app is for the homecook who seeks inspiration. It is for the kitchen chef who wants to calculate recipes. It is for the mindful who watch what they eat and how much. It's also for the students who wants to cook tasty but cheap. It is also for all amateurs in the kitchen who can now match flavors perfectly in two clicks.

> This app is created to satisfy the need of browsing several cookbooks at once. You can track your nutrition, calculate your food costs, create recipes, match flavors, discover flavor affinities or simply find what you can cook with all the products that you have at home on Wednesday evening.

#### Tech stack

> I'm using Next 13 with Supabase (cloud based PostgresQL database), TypeScript, Zod, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, React-Hook-Form, Zustand,  Figma
